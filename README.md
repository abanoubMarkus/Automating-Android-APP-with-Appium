General Store App Automation
Welcome to the General Store App Automation project! This is a sleek, simple automation suite built with Appium to test the "General Store" mobile app. Whether you're a QA enthusiast or a CI/CD junkie, this project has a little something for you—structured code, solid testing, and smooth integration.

What's Inside?
This project is a lightweight yet powerful automation setup with 5 test cases designed to poke and prod the General Store app. Here’s the tech toolbox we’re working with:

Page Object Model (POM): Clean, modular code that keeps things organized and maintainable.
TestNG: The backbone of our test execution—robust, flexible, and ready to roll.
Reports: Detailed test reports to see what’s passing, failing, or just chilling.
Screenshots on Failure: Catch those "oops" moments with automatic screenshots when tests go sideways.
Excel Data Fetching: Test data pulled straight from Excel—because hardcoding is so last decade.
Jenkins CI/CD Integration: Automated builds and tests, seamlessly hooked into Jenkins for that sweet continuous integration vibe.
Project Highlights
5 Test Cases: Small but mighty, covering key functionalities of the General Store app.
Appium-Powered: Mobile automation at its finest, driving the app like a pro.
Failure-Proofing: Screenshots and reports mean you’ll never miss a bug’s big moment.

Why This Project?
This isn’t just a random script dump—it’s a tidy example of mobile app automation done right. Whether you’re learning Appium, exploring TestNG, or setting up Jenkins, this project gives you a solid starting point. Plus, it’s small enough to tinker with but packed with real-world features.

Troubleshooting
Java Version Issues? Ensure you’re on a compatible JDK (e.g., 17 or whatever your pom.xml demands).
Appium Not Playing Nice? Double-check your server setup and device/emulator config.
Screenshots Missing? Verify your file paths and permissions.
